About a year ago, I was diagnosed with cancer. I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning. And it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas. I didn't even know what a pancreas was. The doctors told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable. And that I should expect to live no longer than 3 tot 6 months. My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order, which is doctor's code for prepare to die. It means to try and tell your kids everything. You thought you'd have the next 10 years to tell them in just a few months. It means to make sure everything is buttoned up. So that it will be as easy as possible for your family. It means to say your goodbyes. I lived with that diagnosis all day. Later that evening I had a biopsy. Where they stuck an endoscope down my throat, through my stomach and into my intestines. Put a needle into my pancreas and got a few cells from the tumor. I was sedated but my wife who was there, told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope, the doctor started crying. Because it turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery. I had the surgery and thankfully I'm fine now.
